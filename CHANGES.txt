Changes
=======

1.0.0 (2016-11-15)
------------------

- Manylinux1 targets for Shapely and Fiona have been added to the existing one
  for Rasterio.
- Python 3.3 has been dropped from the macosx wheel targets. Binary releases
  of this version of Python are no longer coming from python.org.
- C asserts are re-enabled in GEOS for compatibility with Homebrew's GEOS 
  formula.
- GDAL version is upgraded to 2.1.2.
- Extra macosx SDK versions have been dropped from wheel platform tags. This
  means that users will need a newer (>6.0) version of pip to install the 
  macosx wheels.
